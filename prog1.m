% This is basically a comment that does not really do anything


% here I change the master itself after branching out with prog3 branch. Basically, we have now two parallel versions---first is prog3, which is a new branch and another is continuation with the master, which is this. We want to test if we can pull requests from prog3 branch to now-updated master, which has a life of its own on account of the addition of this line.


% now I have added another comment for the program that does not even exist as of now.


% (psb) now I am trying a branch to the program; this branch is called prog2.


% (psb) this is another comment for a branch after merging the first branch with the master.
